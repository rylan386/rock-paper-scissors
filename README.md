Live view: [https://rylan386.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/]

A rock paper scissors game created with html, css, and javascript as part of The Odin Project's curriculum.

I knew very little about javascript going into this so i've learned a lot abut DOM manipultion, browser compatibility, debugging, styling and designing an interactive webpage, etc.
